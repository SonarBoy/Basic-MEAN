CommonJS Standards specify the folloing key components
when working with modules.

Require(): A method that is used to laod the module into your code.

Exports: An object thats contained in each module and allows you to 
expose pieces of your code when the module is loaded

module: an object that was originally used to provide metadata information
about the mdoule. It also contains the pointer of an exports object as a property
However the popular implementation of the exports object as a stand alone object 
literally changed the use case of the module object
