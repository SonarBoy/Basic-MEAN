Commands and going through mongo installation:

1: Downloads the authentic key from the keystore validating that your download is from the correct provider.
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 9DA31620334BD75D9DCB49F368818C72E52529D4

2:Creates a list file that mongo will use later in the installation processs
echo "deb [ arch=amd64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.0.list

3:Updates your local packages.
sudo apt-get update

4:Install packages from the ubuntu app store with the latest version.
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org

RUNNING MONGO:

1:Starts Mongo as a service.
sudo service mongod start

2: Verify mongo has started on the correct port. FIND the following line "[initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27017"
sudo less /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

3:Stopping mongo 
sudo service mongod stop

4:Using mongo on the command line
mongo

Installation of Mongoose

npm i mongoose --save

typings
sudo npm i @types/mongoose --save

More catchup to make things work (typings):
sudo npm i @types/cookie-parser @types/body-parser @types/morgan morgan @types/node --save-dev


mongo conection string:
mongodb://username:password@hostname:port/database

localhost connection string
mongodb://localhost/mean-book


Using Mongoose in your Application:

APP.JS APP.JS APP.JS APP.JS APP.JS
//Database setup
var mongoose = require('mongoose');

//Database configuration
var db = require('./config/db');

//Connecting mongoose to the local database
mongoose.connect(db.URI);

//Listening for errors and connection to server
var MongoDB = mongoose.connection;
MongoDB.on('error',console.error.bind(console,"Connection Error: "));
MongoDB.once('open',() =>{
  console.log("Connected to MongoDB...");
});

+ This allows you to connect to the mongoose application.
+ First you will require the mongoose module.
+ Second you will require the config string for the mongoose connection.
+ Third you will create a mongo object to tie the connection to the application.
+ Fourth you will print out add the on function that will print out the error on the server side.
+ Fifth you will use the once method to allow for the server to spit out the fact that you have connected.

APP.JS APP.JS APP.JS APP.JS APP.JS

DB.JS DB.JS DB.JS DB.JS DB.JS DB.JS 

module.exports = {
    "URI":"mongodb://localhost/Nutrition"
}

DB.JS DB.JS DB.JS DB.JS DB.JS DB.JS 

+ this is the connection string in another file. use in ./config/db
+ Now you will create two different files in two different folders. 
first ./model/contact.js and ./routes/contact.js 

contact.js contact.js contact.js contact.js contact.js contact.js MODEL

var mongoose = require('mongoose');

//create model class
var vitaminSchema = mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    chem_Name: String,
    solubility: String
},{
    collection: "Vitamins"
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('test',vitaminSchema);

contact.js contact.js contact.js contact.js contact.js contact.js MODEL

+ require the mongoose module 
+ you then create a model that will represent the data that is comming in in this case its 
+ the name chem_name and solubility and you will add the collection that you are pulling from in this case vitamins.
+ you then export the module to the name 'test'.

contact.js contact.js contact.js contact.js contact.js contact.js ROUTES

//Necessary for building the applicating
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();
var mongoose = require('mongoose');

//Schema: creating reference to database schema
let vitamin = require('../models/contact.js');

//GET OPERATION Simple show of all the vitamins

router.get('/',(request,response,next) =>{
    vitamin.find((error,vitaminList) => {
        if(error){
            return console.error(error);
        }else{
            console.log(vitaminList);

            //Here we will later do a response.render

            /*
                res.render('contacts/index',{
                    title: 'Vitamin List',
                    vitaminList: vitaminList
                })
            */
        }
    });
});

module.exports = router;

contact.js contact.js contact.js contact.js contact.js contact.js ROUTES

+ simple creation of the router in the first three lines while requiring mongoose
+ we then import the contact model from the models folder to use in our routes
+ we then create the root route and use the "vitamin" object to find what is in there 
+ setup the case for the error handling and if it finds an error it will dump it out to the console.
+ if it doesnt find an error wit will write out everything to a variable called "vitaminList" and we will print that out. 



APP.JS APP.JS APP.JS APP.JS APP.JS


var vitaminRouter = require('./routes/contact');
+ create the router object 

app.use('/vitamin-list',vitaminRouter);
+ allow the application to use the url/vitamin-list to call the mongoose object to pull from the database.
