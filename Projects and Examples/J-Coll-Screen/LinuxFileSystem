Linux Cares about filename capitalization

FHS: Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.

/bin: most basic binaries like "ls" and "cat" applications
/sbin: system binaries that the administrator uses.
/boot: contains your boot loaders
/dev: this is where your devices live example disk
      dev/sda think also of serial ports. Partitions /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2
/etc: edit to configure all your system wide confiurations are stored.
/lib: storage of libraries that the binaries use
/mnt: place that other drives are mounted to.
/media: similar to mount but the distro does it automatically.
/opt: manually installed software is installed here.
/proc: sudo files that contain information about sudo processes and resources.
/root: root users home folder.
/run: temfs file system. used to store processes early in the runtime to store process 
      information.
/snap: self-contained applications usually used to run on ubuntu.
/srv: where service data is stored. if you run an ftp you will store the ftp files here.
/sys: system folder way to interact with the kernel. created when the system boots up.
/tmp: files saved here are temporary used as a recovery point if applications close abruptly.
/usr: user application space. unix system resource no esential applications
/var: variable directory. holds files or directories expected to grow in size.
/home: where each user stores their own personal files and documents.
hidden directories start with . cntrl + h exposes them.
