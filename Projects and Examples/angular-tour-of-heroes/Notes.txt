Create Project:

ng new (Project Name here).

What this does:
+ a new workspace with the (Project Name) as the root
+ initial skeleton app located in the src folder
+ End to End (e2e) test project
+ related config files

Serving up the application:
cd (Project Name)

ng serve --open

+ Starts the dev server and watches the source files
  and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those
  files.

+ The application Shell is the web page which is controlled
  by the AppComponent.


app.component.ts = the component class code
app.component.html = the component template
app.component.css = the components stylesheet

{{}} = Angulars interpolation binding syntax


=========================

To generate new compoenets for your application

ng generate component heros

initial import to make things work in the TS file:
import {Component, OnInit} from '@angular/core';

@Component is a decorator function that specifies the Angular
metadata for the component.

selector - the components CSS element selector
templateUrl - the location of the components template file
styleUrls - the location of the components private CSS styleUrls

ngOnInit() is a lifecycle hook here is where you put initialization
logic

+ To display the HerosComponent you must add it to the template of the Shell
AppComponent
+ remember app-heros is the element selector for the Heros Component
so in app.component.html
we add:

<h1>{{title}}<h1>
<app-heros></app-heros>

we then make the following changes

Create a class called
src/app/hero.ts

export class Hero {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

we then modify our heroes.component.ts class to reflect the following

import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Hero } from '../hero';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-heroes',
  templateUrl: './heroes.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./heroes.component.css']
})
export class HeroesComponent implements OnInit {
  hero: Hero = {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Windstorm'
  };

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() {
  }

}


this allows us to display data from our typescript file into the
heros html template file.
